# A monotonically increasing number used to identify points at which an upgrade to the scene data 
# should be made. Every time a new upgrade script is added, this number should be increased by 1 
# and included in the upgrade script's name. The number is saved to the scene, so we can compare
# the current value with the value in a loaded scene and determine which upgrade scripts should
# be run.
# Numbers 0 and 1 are reserved for the scene versions before the upgrade number feature was introduced
